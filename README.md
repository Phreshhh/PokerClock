# Phresh Poker Clock

## Short story

- Who deals?
- Am I the blind?"

Does it sound familiar? - then this app will be useful for you!"

A friendly poker party in da' house, a bit drinking, talking, laughing, etc.
Sometimes I forgot about I'm the one of the blinds.. and you?

## Features

- Save tokens
- Save players
- Setup the match (select 2-10 players, 5 tokens, blindlift type and time, etc)
- track rebuys (optional), tokens (at start and rebuy value), blind values and blindlift time, real bets (optional)

### Blindlift types

- Fix (Fix on the two smallest value token and not lift it) - for slower games
- Gradual (the next small blind is always the previous big blind) - for normal games
- Token pairs (the next small blind is the next value token after previous big blind, and after the highest token double the values of blinds) - for faster games
